      <h2>California Salary After Tax — How Take-Home Pay Works</h2>

      <p>
        Your California take-home pay is your gross salary minus required taxes like federal income tax,
        FICA (Social Security and Medicare), California state income tax, and CA SDI.
        This calculator helps estimate what actually lands in your bank account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Filing status, deductions, and bonuses can significantly affect net pay.
        Two people earning the same salary can have very different take-home results.
